This web scraper uses [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) to download Suncor related files from the [Colorado Environmental Records](http://environmentalrecords.colorado.gov/HPRMWebDrawer/Record) website. To get started, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project root directory which will install all `scrapy` dependencies.

The scrapy has two arguments: `save_path` and `airs_id`. The `save_path` argument specifies the directory you want the .pdfs and metadata .txts to be saved. The scrapy can be run by calling for instance `scrapy crawl cers_scraper -a save_path=C:/Users/andys/Desktop/cers_scraper -a airs_id=001-0003`.
